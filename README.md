## Christian Lindler

I specialize in Machine Learning at the Georgia Institute of Technology, where I am pursuing a combined bachelor's and master's degree in computer science.
I have experience across the stack in many different programming languages including Python, Javascript, and C.
On my GitHub, I have multiple personal projects where I explore my passions like the intersection of computer science and finance.
